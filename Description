🔧 System Overview
🎯 Your Goal:
Read barrel level (20–450 cm sensor range)

Logic: If water ≥ 25%, use barrel + solenoids

Else, use network + solenoids

Steer pump and valves via relay module (aka power repeater)

🛒 Components Needed

🧠 Wiring Summary
🔌 Power:
Raspberry Pi → powered via USB-C (5V)

12V DC power supply → to pump + solenoids via relays

Flyback diode on each inductive device (pump, solenoids)

⚡ Relay (Repeater) Wiring:
Each relay has:

IN pin → GPIO from Pi

VCC → 5V on Pi

GND → Pi ground

COM/NO → switches 12V power to devices (normally off until triggered
